# **App Name**: QRickit

## Core Features:

- Data Input: Accept user input for URL, text, Wi-Fi credentials, contact information, and phone number.
- QR Code Generation: Generate QR code as a static image (PNG or SVG) based on the user-provided data. The user can set the desired pixel size and desired amount of error correction to encode within the QR code (high error correction allows the QR code to function even when significantly obscured).
- Download QR Code: Provide a button to download the generated QR code image.
- AI-Powered Design Tool: Incorporate a generative AI tool that provides design advice, such as optimal sizes and colors for readability (particularly inverse QR codes) and scannability based on user input and use case, as well as context-appropriate color and style suggestions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid purple (#9F50C7), suggesting creativity and innovation.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F4F0F8), providing a soft, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#50C7B5), complementing the purple with a fresh, contrasting highlight.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, geometric icons for different input types (URL, text, Wi-Fi) for visual clarity.
- Clean, intuitive layout with a prominent QR code preview and clearly labeled input fields.
- Subtle animation on QR code generation and download button for enhanced user feedback.
